# Pentatope
Physically based renderer for 4-dimensional space.


This is *not* based on 4-dimensional version of Maxwell equation.
Rather, this is a natural extension of geometric optics
(and light transport equation) to 4-dimensional space.


Implementation details, especially class hierarchy is designed under
heavy influence of [pbrt](http://www.pbrt.org/).
